		<h1>Sketches Assignment</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<P>I'm inspired by <a href="http://www.hem.com/" target="_blank">Hem</a>, and <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/" target="_blank">Fiftythree.</a></P>
		
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Hem.com</p>
		<UL>
			<li><strong>Space:</strong>it has large negative (white) space so people’s eyes can focus on the products</li>
			<li><strong>Size:</strong>the size of each product/furniture is quite large- indicating the importance.</li>
			<li><strong>Balance:</strong>elements are balanced horizontally, which make hem.com a symmetrical design.</li>

		</UL>
		<p>Fiftythree.com</p>
		<UL>
			<li><strong>Space:</strong>the page is dominated by a hero image, on which the positive space is occupied by an “ipad” to illustrate the product- fiftythree app.</li>
			<li><strong>Size:</strong>the size of image obviously emphasizes its importance- it wants people to focus on this image and understand what 53 is about.</li>
			<li><strong>Balance:</strong>fiftythree.com also use symmetrical design- the “watch video” and “visit mix” buttons are horizontally balanced; while logo and the social media icons are also horizontally balanced.</li>
		</UL>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p><strong>Similar:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>They are both horizontally balanced.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Different:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The landing page for hem.com is longer, you can scroll down further, while the landing page for fiftythree.com is much shorter, and it only contains a hero image and company info at bottom. </li>
			<li>The focus of hem.com is to display their high-end products and design, and the call-to-action is for customers to shop. However, the single main focus of fiftythree.com is to show you how awesome their app is, so their call-to-action is to encourage you to watch the video.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Here is my thumnail sketch that I created in Balsamiq:</h2>
		<img src="images/sketch.png" alt="">
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Thumbnail 1:</strong><br><img src="images/thumbnail1.png" alt=""></li>
			<li><strong>Thumbnail 2:</strong><br><img src="images/thumbnail2.png" alt=""></li>
			<li><strong>Thumbnail 3:</strong><br><img src="images/thumbnail3.png" alt=""></li>

		</ul>
		<p>The focal point is thumbnail2, the hero image of artwork, its size and space easily draw people's eyes to start from here. Thumbnail1 is the navigation bar which list the key sites for people to visit. Thumbnail3 is a cue to scroll down to some other sections of the page. My design is horizontally balanced, which is reflected in the hero image and the navigation bar.</p>
